<h1>WSF-v0.1</h1>
<p>WSF (aka., Web Server F#%$!@) is a piece of code to exploit Web Server (PHP) and MySQL Server.</p>
<p>The code commented and is fairly simple to understand with basic knowledge of PHP and MySQL. The script was originally designed to non-paying client's web server, such that we can still retain the full control of the server even if the credentials are changed by over smart and non-paying client. I have had a lot of experience working with shitty-client(s) and have found a greater use of this script.</p>
<p>You must use this script own your own risk.</p>

<br/>

<h3>How to use?</h3>
<p>You need to upload 'wsf-v0.1.php' file to some location in web server where it cannot be easily located. I recommend to rename the file to something that is common in web server and will not be deleted (Ex. web.php).</p>
<br/>
<p>All functionalities are offered in 'wsf-v0.1.php' in Query String, but the upload needs help of a HTML file for upload a file using POST request. For which, their exists 'upload_wsf-v0.1.html' file. However, you need to change the 'action' attribute in 'upload_wsf-v0.1.html' file to point to location where you have uploaded the 'wsf-v0.1.php' (or any other PHP file name).</p>
<p>That's it. Happy exploiting.</p>
<br/>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not use it for wrong intentions.</p>

<p>I never though of modifying this code, because it was enough for my use. However, if you want to improve / have some doubts / found some bugs than please reach me at <a href="mailto:chettri@live.com">chettri@live.com</a>.</p>
