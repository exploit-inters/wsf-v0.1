<h1>WSF-v0.1</h1>
<p>WSF (aka., Web Server F#%$!@) is a piece of code to exploit Web Server (PHP) and MySQL Server.</p>
<p>The code is commented and is fairly simple to understand even with the basic knowledge of PHP and MySQL. The script was originally designed for shitty-client we were reluctant to pay for work. The script is uploaded at some location in web server such that we can still retain the full control of the server even if the credentials are changed. Reason why I wrote this is because I have had a lot of experience working with shitty-client(s) and have found a greater use for this script. You might need this as well, but you must use this script at your own risk.</p>
<p><script>NOTE:</script> This script works, if you already know the server credentials.</p>
<br/>

<h3>How to use?</h3>
<p>Upload 'wsf-v0.1.php' file to some smart location in web server and follow the documentation in 'wsf-v0.1.php'. That's it ;)</p>

<br/>

<p><strong>REQUEST:</strong> Do not use it for wrong intentions.</p>
